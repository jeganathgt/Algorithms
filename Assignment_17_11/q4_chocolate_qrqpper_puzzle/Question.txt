Q4.	Chocolate	and	Wrapper	Puzzle
• Given	following three	values,	the	task	is	to	find	the	total	number	of	maximum	chocolates	you	can	eat.

• money	:	Money	you	have	to	buy	chocolates
• price	:	Price	of	a	chocolate
• wrap	:	Number	of	wrappers	to	be	returned	for	getting	one	extra	chocolate.

It	may	be	assumed	that	all	given	values	are	positive	integers	and	greater	than	1.


• Examples 1:

• Input	:			money	=	16,	price	=	2,	wrap	=	2
• Output	:			15
Price	of	a	chocolate	is	2.	You	can	buy	8	chocolates	from	amount	16.	You	can	return	8	wrappers	back	and	
get	4	more	Chocolates.	Then	you	can	return	4	wrappers	and	get	2	more	chocolates.	Finally	you	can	
return	2	wrappers	to	get	1	more	chocolate.


Example 2:
• Input	:			money	=	15,	price	=	1,	wrap	=	3
• Output	:			22
• We	buy	and	eat	15	chocolates		We	return	15	wrappers	and	get	5	more	chocolates.	We	return	3	
wrappers,	get	1	chocolate	and	eat	it	(keep	2	wrappers).	Now	we	have	3	wrappers.	Return	3	and	get	1	
more	chocolate.	So	total	chocolates	=	15	+	5	+	1	+	1



Example 3:
• Input	:		money	=	20,	price	=	3,	wrap	=	5
• Output	:			7
