Q6.	Recursive	solution	to	count	substrings	with	same	first	and	last	
characters
We	are	given	a	string	S,	we	need	to	find	count	of	all	contiguous	
substrings	starting	and	ending	with	same	character.


Examples 1  :	
Input	:	S	=	"abcab"	Output	:	7

There	are	15	substrings	of	"abcab"	
a,	ab,	abc,	abca,	abcab,	b,	bc,	bca bcab,	c,	ca,	cab,	a,	ab,	b	
Out	of	the	above	substrings,	there	are	7	substrings	:	a,	abca,	b,	bcab,	c,	a	
and	b.
